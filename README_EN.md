# AutoReply Judge Plugin

An **AstrBot** plugin that submits group chat messages to an LLM for semantic analysis, intelligently determining whether an automatic reply should be triggered.

---

## Features

- **LLM-Powered Judgment** — Message content along with recent context is sent to an LLM to decide whether a reply is warranted.
- **Probabilistic Fallback** — When the LLM deems a reply unnecessary, a configurable probability allows occasional replies to keep interactions lively.
- **In-Group Toggle Command** — Send `/reply` in any group to enable or disable the judgment function on the fly.
- **Independent Judge Model** — Select a lightweight model dedicated to judgment to reduce costs, while the main model handles actual conversations.

---

## Installation

Place the plugin folder into `data/plugins/`, reload plugins, then enable it from the management panel.

---

## Configuration

| Key | Description | Default |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `enabled` | Master switch | `true` |
| `judge_provider` | Model provider for judgment (dropdown; leave empty to use the conversation model) | (empty) |
| `judge_prompt` | Prompt template for the judgment LLM (variables: `{message}`, `{context}`, `{sender}`) | See below |
| `context_size` | Number of recent messages to include as context (set to `0` to disable) | `3` |
| `history_maxlen` | Max number of recent messages cached locally (affects local cache only, not the context sent to LLM) | `10` |
| `reply_chance` | Probability (0–100) of replying even when the LLM says no | `20` |

### Default Judge Prompt

```
You are a group chat bot assistant. Determine whether the following message requires a reply.

Rules:
1. The message mentions the bot's name or @'s the bot → Reply
2. The message asks a question or requests help → Reply
3. The message is interacting with the bot → Reply
4. Casual chatting unrelated to the bot → Do not reply
5. Pure emoji or meaningless messages → Do not reply

Respond strictly in JSON format (JSON only):
{"should_reply": true/false, "confidence": 0-100, "reason": "Brief reason"}

Current message:
{message}

Recent context:
{context}
```

**Available variables:** `{message}`, `{context}`, `{sender}`

---

## Commands

Send in any group chat:

```
/reply
```

Toggles the judgment function on/off for that group.  
You can also specify a state directly: `/reply true` or `/reply false`.

> 🧠 **Persistent state:** Group switch states are automatically saved to `_group_switches.json` and restored after AstrBot restart — no need to reconfigure every time.

## About the ERROR Log on Interception

When the plugin determines that a message does not need a reply and terminates the pipeline, AstrBot's built-in handler raises a `GeneratorExit` exception due to the generator being prematurely closed. This is standard behavior when a generator is closed normally. The log will display:

```
[ERRO] [astrbot.main:222]: Traceback (most recent call last):
File "...", line ..., in on_message
    yield event.request_llm(
GeneratorExit
[ERRO] [astrbot.main:223]: 主动回复失败:
```

This exception **does not affect functionality** — the message has been successfully intercepted and will not be sent to the group. The plugin automatically filters these logs via `logging.Filter` during initialization to keep the console output clean.
